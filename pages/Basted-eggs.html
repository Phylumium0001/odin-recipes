        <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>A basted egg is somewhere between a sunny side up fried egg and a poached egg. Basted eggs are fried on the bottom and steamed on top. They look similar to sunny side up eggs, but the yolk is slightly more set.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Butter:</strong> These traditional basted eggs are cooked in butter on the stove.</li>
            <li><strong>Water:</strong> A tablespoon of water helps steam the top of the egg.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> When the eggs are done, season them with flaky sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> This recipe makes two basted eggs. You can easily adjust the measurements to make more or less.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Cooking Process</h4>
            <p>You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below â€” but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make a basted egg at home:

                Crack the egg into a skillet with melted butter. When the whites are mostly set, add water and cover. Cook until some of white has set over the yolk.</p>
