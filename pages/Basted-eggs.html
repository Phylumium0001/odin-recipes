            <p>A basted egg is somewhere between a sunny side up fried egg and a poached egg. Basted eggs are fried on the bottom and steamed on top. They look similar to sunny side up eggs, but the yolk is slightly more set.</p>

                Crack the egg into a skillet with melted butter. When the whites are mostly set, add water and cover. Cook until some of white has set over the yolk.</p>
